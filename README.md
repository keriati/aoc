Advent of Code solutions in TypeScript
======================================

All solutions are implemented in TypeScript and executed against Jest tests.

The starting input for the puzzles is usually stored in dayXX.txt files.

## Running tasks:

To run all tests use:

    npm run test

or by year, for example:

    npm run test:2015

## Notes

- 2022 day 15 runs for 20sec in jest. Use the included runner to get the result in 500ms. **npm run run201515**
